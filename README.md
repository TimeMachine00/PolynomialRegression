created by hussainatphysics@gmail.com(hussainsha syed)
here we perfom polynomial regression and linear regression for the dataset
we compare RMSE and score of polynomial regression with linear regression
we conclude that polynomial regression is much better than linear regression
we also compare RMSE and score of polynomial regression of degree two with polynomial regression with degree 4
we conclude that polynomial regression with degree 4 is much better than polynomial regression of degree two
