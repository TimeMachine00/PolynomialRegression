1)  here we perfom polynomial regression and linear regression for the dataset
2)  we compare RMSE and score of polynomial regression with linear regression
3)  we conclude that polynomial regression is much better than linear regression
4)  we also compare RMSE and score of polynomial regression of degree two with polynomial regression with degree 4
5)  we conclude that polynomial regression with degree 4 is much better than polynomial regression of degree two
